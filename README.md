### Project summary: “Your Calls”

Yours Calls is a web app to register the phone calls that receive the employees from Interacso, the company we are working for. It includes a call history, call statistics and slack notifications. 

This is a inheritated project. The original project included these features:

## Project Objectives: “Your Calls 1.0”

1. Phone calls registry and call history availability.

2. Saved information about the call.

3. Automatic notifications with the registered call data through Slack.

4. This functionality works using a private OAuth Access Token that is provided by Slack. 
        
        As it is private, it has been stored in a file called .env.local and then added to the .gitignore folder. 

         - Example: REACT_APP_SKEY=xoxp-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


In “Your Calls 2.0” we add new funcionalities on the Single Page Application, in order to use it to make business decissions:
